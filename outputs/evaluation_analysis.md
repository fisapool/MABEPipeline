### üîç Detailed Analysis

#### Prediction Volume vs Quality
- ‚úÖ **Prediction Generation**: Successfully increased from 1,116 to 2,232 predictions (100% increase)
- ‚ùå **Prediction Quality**: F-score remains at 0.0, indicating no accurate predictions
- ‚ùå **Behavior Coverage**: All behavior F-scores are 0.0
- ‚ùå **Video Coverage**: All video F-scores are 0.0

#### Root Cause Analysis

The 0.0 F-score suggests several potential issues:

1. **Model Calibration Issues**:
   - Confidence scores still very low (~0.17)
   - Temperature scaling may not be sufficient
   - Model may be fundamentally underfitted

2. **Class Imbalance Still Severe**:
   - 2 classes (rear, shepherd) have 0 samples
   - 1 class (chaseattack) severely underrepresented (4.2%)
   - SMOTE may not be generating meaningful synthetic samples

3. **Feature Quality Issues**:
   - 26-dimensional features may not be informative enough
   - Tracking data quality may be poor
   - Feature extraction may be flawed

4. **Model Architecture Limitations**:
   - CNN with attention may not be suitable for this task
   - Model may be too complex for the amount of data
   - Need simpler baseline models first

### üèÜ Conclusion

While we successfully implemented all planned improvements and achieved a 100% increase in prediction generation, the fundamental issue of model performance remains. The 0.0 F-score indicates that we need to focus on:

1. **Data Quality**: Ensure features are meaningful and informative
2. **Model Simplicity**: Start with simpler models and build complexity gradually
3. **Aggressive Class Imbalance Solutions**: More aggressive approaches to address missing classes

The infrastructure and framework we've built provides an excellent foundation for these next steps. The key is to focus on the fundamentals: data quality, model simplicity, and aggressive class imbalance solutions.
